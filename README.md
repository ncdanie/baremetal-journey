## Introduction

I'm attempting to program my own simple OS. I'll be using the README as a blog page to track resources and outline my experience.

I'm working with a Raspberry Pi 4 and a BeagleBone Black board. Hopefully, I'll be able to get something up and running on both! My typical development environment is Ubuntu on WSL, but if I run into difficulties I may use Windows or hop over to my laptop where I've got PopOS and Fedora.
